# daily-weather-forecast
This python script - hosted as task on [pythonanywhere.com](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) - sends a daily mail with today's weather forecast.

The weather data is collected via the [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/) API.

The data is plotted, stored as a .png file and then attached in the HTML-body of the email.

This is an example of how the created graph looks:<br>
