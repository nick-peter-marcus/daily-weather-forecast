# daily-weather-forecast
This python script (hosted as task on pythonanywhere.com) sends daily mails with the day's weather forecast.

Weather data (temperature, UV-index, and probability of precipitation) are collected via the openweathermap.org API.

The data is plotted, stored as a .png file and then attached in the HTML-body of the email.

This is an example for how the created graph looks:<br>
